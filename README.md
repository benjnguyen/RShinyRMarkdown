# RShinyRMarkdown

This repository contains code relating to producing a dashboard in RMarkdown while integrating R shiny (dynamic elements/web application).
The code informs how to initialize and ask for multiple user inputs, reactive programming that returns calculated results with respect to user input, and generating graphs whose parameters are reactive variables. It also introduces a way to scrape financial data using a ticker symbol representing a company's name from Yahoo Finance. An improvement upon the application would be to impose that the portf. % sum to 100% and when the sum reaches 100%, that the numeric inputs restrict themselves to impose the implied percentage of portfolio constraint.
